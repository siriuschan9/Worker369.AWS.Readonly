# Worker369.AWS.Readonly

- This is a collection of cmdlets and tools that I have developed to support my own work on the AWS platform.

- This module itself is not hardened and not intended to be production-ready but anyone can adapt it to meet their own needs.

- This is the readonly version of Worker369.AWS module - exporting out only read-based cmdlets.
